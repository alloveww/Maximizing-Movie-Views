## Background and Introduction
This project analyzes a dataset for an independent film company aiming to optimize its resource allocation for more Netflix movie views. The dataset includes attributes like title, language, runtime, director, and scores from various review sites. The objectives are data wrangling, exploratory analysis, regression tree modeling, and creating an H-index for directors.

## Objectives
**Task 1: Data Wrangling and Exploratory Data Analysis**
- Clean the dataset to focus on movies and handle missing values.
- Perform exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and relationships.
- Determine associations between Hidden Gem Score and runtime or languages.
- Assess correlations between Hidden Gem Scores and review scores (IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic).
- Analyze trends in Hidden Gem Scores over time by runtime category.
  
**Task 2: Factors of the Hidden Gem Score**
- Identify key factors contributing to the Hidden Gem Score using a regression tree model.
  
**Task 3: An H-index for Directors**
- Develop an HG-H index to rank directors based on the Hidden Gem Scores of their films.
- Create a table of the top 10 directors according to the ***HG-H*** index.
